## Documentation Spaces

Documentation spaces act as containers for your projects. Create a space for each major initiative, such as API docs or user guides. Each space maintains its own permissions, themes, and navigation.

<Callout kind="info">
  Spaces isolate content, preventing cross-contamination while allowing shared components.
</Callout>

Use spaces to scale documentation as your projects grow. For example, separate public user docs from internal developer references.

## Project Organization Strategies

Organize projects within spaces using a consistent structure. Choose strategies based on your team's needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Folder-Based" icon="folder">
    Use nested folders for hierarchical navigation.

    ```
    docs/
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── quickstart/
    │   └── index.mdx
    └── api/
        └── reference.mdx
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tag-Based" icon="tag">
    Apply tags for dynamic filtering and search.

    <CodeGroup tabs="Configuration">
      ```yaml
      # frontmatter example
      ---
      tags: ["core", "api"]
      ---
      ```
      ```javascript
      // Query by tags
      const docs = await fetchDocs({ tags: ["core"] });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid" icon="grid">
    Combine folders and tags for flexibility.

    Start with core folders, then tag pages for cross-references.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Content Types and Versioning

Francisco Rubio supports Markdown, MDX, and custom components. Version content to track changes and publish updates.

graph TD
    A[Draft] --> B[Review]
    B --> C[Publish]
    C --> D[Version 1.0]
    D --> E[Update]
    E --> F[Version 1.1]
```

<Expandable title="Versioning Best Practices" default-open="true">
  Pin versions to branches or tags. Use semantic versioning like `v1.0.0`.

  ```yaml
  # Example frontmatter with version
  ---
  title: API Reference
  version: "1.2.0"
  ---
  ```
</Expandable>
